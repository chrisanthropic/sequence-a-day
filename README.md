## WHAT
I'm learning to use Hydrogen and ZynSubAddFx/Zyn-Fusion. For practice I'm going to create a single "something" every day in October and save it here.


## WHY
Inspired by my friends in the fine-arts and their "Inktober" daily sketch challenges I decided that the best way to keep learning these new tools is to just play around a little bit every day.

I'm more concerned with learning the tools and playing with new techniques than with actually producing something good - the goal is to play and learn.
